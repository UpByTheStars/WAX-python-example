Some easy to use and understand examples of sending wax and staking wax CPU + NET (works with eos also)

This uses eospy and has easy-to-read code with pretty simple instructions.
--> All of this can be pretty easily added into any project use the examples as a skeleton

CPU can be a problem when pushing many transactions, make sure you stake some and have some handy incase you need any extra resources.


Don't expect me to update this much - I may add some more examples in the future but don't count on it.

Oh also dont be "that guy" - python can be installed here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and you can get the eospy package using "pip install eospy" or the equivilent depending on your python version / opperating system.
